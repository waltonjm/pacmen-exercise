# PacMen Exercise
## Description
MIT xProÂ® Professional Certificate in Coding Boot Camp Project: PacMen Exercise. This project involved DOM manipulation in which we inserted multiple pac men upon a mouse click which then subsequently bounced off screen walls. 

## Installation
Clone the index.html, pacmen.js, and all the image files into your source code editor of choice. Then create an about:blank page in your browser of choice and move the index.html file into the search bar.

## Usage
Click on the Add PacMen and then click on start and watch the PacMen bounce around.

## Support
The Pac Man game and support is now available for mobile devices. Go to Google Play Store or the Apple App Store to download.

## Roadmap
This project is presented as a part of student boot camp portfolio.
